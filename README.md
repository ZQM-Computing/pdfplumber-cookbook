A **pdfplumber cookbook** — table and text extraction from PDFs. Queued in wave-11 (per-node adds). Patterns are planned from the design, not yet from fleet runs. It is intended for Developers who pull tables and text out of PDFs into DataFrames. Validate each pattern against your own data, software versions, and operating environment before adopting it.

## Repository role and status

**Status:** Active, public — seeding. Pattern passes land in follow-up work from fleet-verified setups; the tables below list what is planned, not what is already written.

**What this repository is:** pdfplumber patterns — see the table below.

**What it contributes:** Part of the ZQM Computing geospatial portfolio. The umbrella index for the series is [geospatial-cookbooks](https://github.com/ZQM-Computing/geospatial-cookbooks).

**Standing:** This repository is maintained independently. Automated checks cover only the paths and environments configured in its workflows; they do not establish production readiness or operational certification.

## Who this is for

Developers who pull tables and text out of PDFs into DataFrames.

## Prerequisites

- pdfplumber in the fleet Python environment
- Python 3.11+
- A sample PDF with tables

## Patterns (planned)

| # | Example | What it will demonstrate |
|---|---------|--------------------------|
| 01 | `01-text-extract` | Extracting text with word and line awareness |
| 02 | `02-tables` | Extracting tables into DataFrames |
| 03 | `03-crop-filter` | Cropping pages and filtering objects |
| 04 | `04-report-pipeline` | A reporting pipeline: PDF tables → DataFrame → analysis |

## Repository layout

## Roadmap

- First pattern pass: the first two table rows
- Second pass: the remaining rows, from fleet-verified setups

## Contributing

A contributing guide lands with the first pattern pass. Report security issues to <zqmcomputing@gmail.com> — please do not open a public issue for those.
